# Ekino Monitoring Stack

## Description

This repo contains the following docker images sources :
* [`ekino/influxdb`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ekino/influxdb/)
* [`ekino/grafana`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ekino/grafana/)
* [`ekino/collectd`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ekino/collectd/)

The first two are made to be run in production environments.

The third one is more here to complete the stack but may be kind of meaningless
as you may want to gather data at host level, not at container one.

Though in the context of this project, it is very useful to provide a full
collectd-influxdb-grafana workflow

*This is a work in progress. PR are welcomes folks :)*

## TL;DR

For demo usage purpose :

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekino/docker-monitoring-stack/master/helper.sh | bash -s run
```

Then head to your new [local Grafana instance](http://localhost/)

## Real-life usage

*TODO*
